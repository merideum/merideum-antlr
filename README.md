# merit

ANTLR grammars for the Merit language.
Merit is used to power interaction with a Merideum server.

# Getting Started

This project is organized as a JVM project due to the powerful and helpful ANTLR4 plugin in IntelliJ.
This plugin is used to develop and test the grammar implementation.

Language-specific implementations of Merideum should curl the grammar file(s) from the desired git tag to generate their ANTLR language target (instead of committing the file(s) to source control).
