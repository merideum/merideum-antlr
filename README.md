# Merideum Language

ANTLR grammars for the Merideum scripting language. These grammars are used for Merideum implementations.

# Getting Started

It is recommended to open this project in IntelliJ due to the powerful and useful ANTLR plugin.
This plugin is used to visualize the grammar and test grammar changes manually.

Language-specific implementations of Merideum should curl the grammar file(s) from the desired git tag to generate their ANTLR language target (instead of committing the file(s) to source control).
